A journal application where in users can pen down their thoughts and feelings.

# Andela Journal-App
Journal App is a simple application where in users can pen down their thoughts and feelings. 
The user clicks on a button which takes the user a screen where the user can add an activity and the user can also update an activity by clicking on the item that needs to be updated.

The app uses the **MVVM Architecture**. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* ButterKnife -  minimize the glue code necessary to bind your application logic and layouts
* Firebase – Handles user’s authentication.
